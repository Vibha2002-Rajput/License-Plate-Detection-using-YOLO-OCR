# License Plate Detection using Computer Vision and YOLO + OCR
Developed an automated system to detect and recognize vehicle license plates using OpenCV, YOLOv8 and Tesseract OCR. Implemented contour-based plate detection, image preprocessing, and character recognition. The system efficiently extracts license numbers from images and can be extended to real-time traffic surveillance applications.
